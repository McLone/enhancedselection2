Enhanced Selection Datatype
---------------------------

Installation instructions:

- Unpack the archive

- Place the 'enhancedselection' folder in the 'extension' folder.

- Open /settings/override/site.ini.append(.php) and add the enhancedselection
  extension to the active extensions.

  [ExtensionSettings]
  ActiveExtensions[]=enhancedselection


*****************
* ! IMPORTANT ! *
*****************

Note that if you update this datatype from a version < v4.0 and you made your own 
template for this datatype, its default behavior has changed : collected value isn't 
"Name" field anymore but the "Identifier" field. To get the previous behavior, you can
change ezhancedselection.ini.php to set :
[Settings]
UseNameFieldAsCollectedValue=true



If you have used the previous version (< V2.0) of the Enhanced Selection datatype,
you need to do a bit more if you want to completely switch to this new version.

The two version are not directly compatible and that is why they have a different
datatype identifier. The 'updateenhancedselection.php' provided in the bin/php
folder will take care of the update process. Run it from the root of the eZ Publish
installation to make the switch.
